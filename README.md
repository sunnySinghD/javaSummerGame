javaSummerGame

This is a project I've worked on that is coded entirely in Java. I worked primarily on it over summer in my spare time. Its a simple arcade style game where you gain points for "eating" the enemies after enough collision time. It scales as the player's score increases, and keeps tracks of scores by writing out and reading in to a high scores file. The graphics framework is provided from the use of the Slick library (http://slick.cokeandcode.com/). The artwork is my original work and created in GIMP ( I know its pretty terrible but better than looking at Java's drawn squares/circles ).
